## Supervised Fine-Tuning Phi-4-mini Open-Source Model for Text Q&A - An AI Foundry Dashboard Experience

Learn how to fine-tune a **phi-4-mini-instruct** model using the Azure AI Foundry UI Dashboard.

---

### Prerequisites
* Learn the [what, why, and when to use fine-tuning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/fine-tuning-considerations)
* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* An [Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects) in Azure AI Foundry portal.
* Prepare Training and Validation datasets:
  * at least 70 high-quality samples (preferably 1,000s) are required.
  * must be formatted in the JSON Lines (JSONL) document with UTF-8 encoding.

You can check the MS Learn document [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?tabs=turbo%2Cpython&pivots=programming-language-studio) for more details.
