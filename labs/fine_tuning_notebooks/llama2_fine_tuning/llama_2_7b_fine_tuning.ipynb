    "\n",
    "This sample shows how use `text-generation` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to summarize a dialog between 2 people using samsum dataset. We then deploy the fine tuned model to an online endpoint for real time inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [samsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset. This dataset is intended to summarize dialogues between 2 people. with this notebook we will summarize the dialogues and calculate bleu and rouge scores for the summarized text vs provided ground_truth summaries\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "We will use the `llama-2-7b` model to show how user can finetune a model for text-generation task. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the specific model name. Optionally, if you need to fine tune a model that is available on HuggingFace, but not available in `azureml` system registry, you can either [import](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/system/import/import_model_into_registry.ipynb) the model or use the `huggingface_id` parameter instruct the components to pull the model directly from HuggingFace. \n",
