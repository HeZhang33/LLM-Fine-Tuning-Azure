Pete roared at Lara and turned the music off. Nobody moved at first, but he threatened to call the police!\r\nLouise: Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I bet she was thoroughly embarrassed.\r\nSue: No, not really. About 8 of her friends were sleeping at our house, so they all crashed back there sheepishly.\r\nLouise: Yes, but next day, she must have apologised to you.\r\nSue: She did not! In fact, around 6 of the group came back to the Hall to help clean up, but Lara refused to get out of bed!\r\nLouise: I can't believe she acted so selfishly! \r\nSue: We've made her pay for the damage out of her part time job at the vets and also refused to pay for one of her holidays. \r\nLouise: Yes, you did right! So she's got more than one holiday?\r\nSue: Yes, three! One she paid for herself, mind. She's still hardly speaking to us and it was 2 weeks ago. \r\nLouise: So sorry you've had to go through this, Lara needs to step up here, though!\r\nSue: I know, I think she'll come round. I have a feeling someone sneaked some drugs in and it made a few of them go apeshit! Hope Lara didn't have any.\r\nLouise: I'm sure things will improve. Come and see us all next weekend. Lara loves to see Steve, he's like her little brother. \r\nSue: Yes, I'd love that! See you soon!\r\nLouise: Bye.\n---\nSummary:\n","summary":"Louise and Pete booked the village hall for Lara's 18th birthday. They left her there with guests, who devastated the place and got crazy.

Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\r\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\r\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\r\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\r\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\r\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\r\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\r\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\r\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\r\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\r\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\r\nDiana: Thank you.

I would also gladly make an appointment with you.\r\nTom: That would be perfect!\r\nDiana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable?\r\nTom: Hm, I need to consult it with my wife, but so far it's all right.\n---\nSummary:\n","summary":"Tom and his wife want to sell their apartment and get a new one.
